Whether we are designing a new passive house building from the ground up, retrofitting an old building to reduce its carbon footprint, or just helping clients achieve basic benchmarking reports or regulatory sustainability compliance, we use advanced custom tools in BIM to BEM (Building Information Modeling to Building Energy Modeling) Technology to PPHP, gbXML and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Open Studio for Energy Plus in order to provide building owners with verifiable, measurable, standardized Energy Simulation Analysis.

We apply custom, advanced parametric software to accurately prescribe where to invest in “Energy Proofing” construction elements and building systems on a case by case basis. We also diagnose the variable alternatives that exist in cost, quality + time in order to intelligently provide adaptive physical solutions for better ENERGY performance.

In New York City, we help building owners navigate the NYC Energy Benchmarking Report, Local Law 33, Local Law 95, and Local Law 97 for Green House Gas Emissions for existing buildings. We also design green roof systems for compliance with Local Law 92 + 94 and provide compliant energy data for Federal and State Energy grants and tax incentives by providing Energy Use Intensity (EUI) or Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (GHG) performance data.

We are also well versed in the current New York State Energy Conservation Code (NYCECC), the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC),and ASHRAE Standard 140 and we provide consulting, design and retrofit strategies and plans for developers and building owners.

In the United States, we spend over $400 Billion each year powering our homes and commercial buildings. These building consume 75% of the electricity used in the country. This in turn, is 40% of the United States’ total Energy Consumption.

It is estimated that at a minimum, 30% of this Energy and Money is wasted due to poor Building Design. In addition, Buildings in the United State account for 35% of all CO2 emissions.

For those who care more about their pocket book than the Natural Environment, Energy Saving Improvements in Buildings Saves Money.
